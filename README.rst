 Eye-Blink Detector to Counter Spoofing Attacks
================================================

This package implements an eye-blink detector using a similar frame-differences
technique as described at the paper `Counter-Measures to Photo
Attacks in Face Recognition: a public database and a baseline`, by Anjos and
Marcel, International Joint Conference on Biometrics, 2011.

Raw data
--------

This method was originally conceived to work with the `the PRINT-ATTACK
database <https://www.idiap.ch/dataset/printattack>`_, but has since evolved to
work with the whole of the `the REPLAY-ATTACK database
<https://www.idiap.ch/dataset/replayattack>`_, which is a super-set of the
PRINT-ATTACK database. You are allowed to select protocols in each of the
applications described in this manual.

The data used in these experiments is publicly available and should be
downloaded and installed **prior** to try using the programs described in this
package.

Installation
------------

.. note:: 

  If you are reading this page through our GitHub portal and not through PyPI,
  note **the development tip of the package may not be stable** or become
  unstable in a matter of moments.

  Go to `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/antispoofing.eyeblink
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/antispoofing.eyeblink>`_ to download the latest
  stable version of this package.

There are 2 options you can follow to get this package installed and
operational on your computer: you can use automatic installers like `pip
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ (or `easy_install
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_) or manually download, unpack and
use `zc.buildout <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to create a
virtual work environment just for this package.

Using an automatic installer
============================

Using ``pip`` is the easiest (shell commands are marked with a ``$`` signal)::

  $ pip install antispoofing.eyeblink

You can also do the same with ``easy_install``::

  $ easy_install antispoofing.eyeblink

This will download and install this package plus any other required
dependencies. It will also verify if the version of Bob you have installed
is compatible.

This scheme works well with virtual environments by `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ or if you have root access to your
machine. Otherwise, we recommend you use the next option.

Using ``zc.buildout``
=====================

Download the latest version of this package from `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/antispoofing.eyeblink>`_ and unpack it in your
working area. The installation of the toolkit itself uses `buildout
<http://www.buildout.org/>`_. You don't need to understand its inner workings
to use this package. Here is a recipe to get you started::
  
  $ python bootstrap.py 
  $ ./bin/buildout

These 2 commands should download and install all non-installed dependencies and
get you a fully operational test and development environment.

.. note::

  The python shell used in the first line of the previous command set
  determines the python interpreter that will be used for all scripts developed
  inside this package. Because this package makes use of `Bob
  <http://idiap.github.com/bob>`_, you must make sure that the ``bootstrap.py``
  script is called with the **same** interpreter used to build Bob, or
  unexpected problems might occur.

  If Bob is installed by the administrator of your system, it is safe to
  consider it uses the default python interpreter. In this case, the above 3
  command lines should work as expected. If you have Bob installed somewhere
  else on a private directory, edit the file ``buildout.cfg`` **before**
  running ``./bin/buildout``. Find the section named ``external`` and edit the
  line ``egg-directories`` to point to the ``lib`` directory of the Bob
  installation you want to use. For example::

    [external]
    recipe = xbob.buildout:external
    egg-directories=/Users/crazyfox/work/bob/build/lib

User Guide
----------

It is assumed you have followed the installation instructions for the package
and got this package installed and the REPLAY-ATTACK (or PRINT-ATTACK) database
downloaded and uncompressed in a directory to which you have read access.
Through this manual, we will call this directory ``/root/of/database``. That
would be the directory that *contains* the sub-directories ``train``, ``test``,
``devel`` and ``face-locations``.

Note for Grid Users
===================

At Idiap, we use the powerful Sun Grid Engine (SGE) to parallelize our job
submissions as much as we can. At the Biometrics group, we have developed a
`little toolbox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gridtk>` that can submit and
manage jobs at the Idiap computing grid through SGE.  If you are at Idiap, you
can download and install this toolset by adding ``gridtk`` at the ``eggs``
section of your ``buildout.cfg`` file, if it is not already there. If you are
not, you still may look inside for tips on automated parallelization of
scripts.

The following sections will explain how to reproduce the paper results in
single (non-gridified) jobs. A note will be given where relevant explaining how
to parallalize the job submission using ``gridtk``.

.. note::

  If you decide to run using the grid at Idiap, please note that our Lustre
  filesystem does not work well with SQLite. So, do **not** place the
  ``xbob.db.replay`` package inside that filesystem. You can and **should**
  save your results on ``/idiap/temp`` though.

Calculate Frame Differences
===========================

The eye-blink detector calculates normalized frame differences like our face
*versus* background motion detector at the `antispoofing.motion package
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/antispoofing.motion>`_, except it does it for
the eye region and face remainer (the part of the face that does not contain
the eye region). In the first stage of the processing, we compute the eye
and face remainder regions normalized frame differences for each input video.
To do this, just execute::

  $ ./bin/framediff.py /root/of/database results/framediff

There are more options for the `framediff.py` script you can use (such as the
sub-protocol selection). Note that, by default, all applications are tunned to
work with the **whole** of the replay attack database. Just type `--help` at
the command line for instructions.

.. note::

  To parallelize this job, do the following::

    $ ./bin/jman submit --array=1200 ./bin/framediff.py /root/of/database results/framediff --grid

  The `magic` number of `1200` entries can be found by executing::

    $ ./bin/framediff.py --grid-count

  Which just prints the number of jobs it requires for the grid execution.

Creating Final Score Files
==========================

To create the final score files, you will need to execute ``make_scores.py``,
which contains a simple strategy for producing a single score per input frame
in every video. The final score is calculated from the input eye and face
remainder frame differences in the following way::

  S = ratio(eye/face_rem) - 2 * running_average(ratio(eye/face_rem))

To compute the scores ``S`` for every frame in every input video, do the
following::

  $ ./bin/make_scores.py results/framediff results/scores

There are more options for the `framediff.py` script you can use (such as the
sub-protocol selection). Note that, by default, all applications are tunned to
work with the **whole** of the replay attack database. Just type `--help` at
the command line for instructions.

We don't provide a grid-ified version of this step because the job runs quite
fast, even for the whole database.

Merging Scores - Counting Eye-Blinks
====================================

If you wish to create a single `5-column format file
<http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/docs/nightlies/last/bob/sphinx/html/measure/index.html?highlight=five_col#bob.measure.load.five_column>`_
by combining this counter-measure scores for every video into a single file
that can be fed to external analysis utilities such as our
`antispoofing.evaluation <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/antispoofing.evaluation>`
package, you should use the script ``merge_scores.py``. The merged scores
represent the number of eye-blinks computed for each video sequence. You will
have to specify how many of the scores in every video you will want to consider
and the input directory containing the scores files that will be merged (by
default, the procedure considers only the first 220 frames, which is some sort
of *common denominator* between real-access and attack video number of frames).

The output of the program consists of a single 5-column formatted file with the
client identities and scores for **every video** in the input directory. A line
in the output file corresponds to a video from the database. 

You run this program on the output of ``make_scores.py``. So, it should look
like this if you followed the previous example::

  $ ./bin/merge_scores.py results/scores results

The above commandline example will generate 3 text files on the ``results``
directory containing the training, development and test scores, accumulated
over each video in the respective subsets. You can use other options to limit
the number of outputs in each file such as the protocol or support to use.
